 * compile time polymerphism--early binding/static binding/overloading
 * early binding
 * late binding
 * static binding
 * overloading---same method name but different sinature means in same class we have multiple methods 
 *with same naame but different method signature for example
/ *public class RBI{
 //public Money(string a){//in this programm all methods are having the same name 
 *but parameters which are called as sinature are difference it is called as method overloading
 *}
 *public Money(int b){
 *}public Money(char c){
 //}
 // Can we achive overloading by keeping the method signature same and changing the return type-no
  //because it will not allow it will throw error for duplicate method 
 *
 *}
 * overriding
